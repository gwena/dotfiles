# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Here you'll find some of my dot/config files for GNU/Linux :penguin: (Arch/Manjaro distro), with a focus on Wayland (using Hyprland and Waybar), and previously i3wm.

Feel free to explore, fork, or use any parts of these configurations for your own setup. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please contact me.

Enjoy! :rocket:
